# B.A.R.B.E.C.U.E.S.
B.A.R.B.E.C.U.E.S. (Basically Another Really Badly Enhanced Compressible Unstructured Euler Solver) is a 2D CFD code developed in Python that solves the compressible Euler equations. The code is meant to be a testing ground for novel ideas and features in an effort to push the limits of traditional CFD codes by doing standard processes (i.e. initialization or convergence) in non-standard methods. More information about such features can be found in the Wiki.
